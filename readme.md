I just learnt about Git and Github and it has been so helpful so i decided to create something so i can push. I decided to create a webscraper to get the latest news in my country(Nigeria) and parse out that information into a csv file so you don't just see all the parsed information on the terminal

REQUIREMENT

pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install lxml # which is the parser i used
or 
pip install html5lib #if that doesn't work for you
pip install requests

And you should be good to go
